## Lessons Learned

During the course of this project, the following key observations were made regarding the behavior of functions in JavaScript:

- I learned that when assigning a function name without parentheses (e.g. `var myFunc = myFunction`), the function itself is stored in the variable, and this can also be done by assigning the function to a variable with parentheses (e.g. `var myFunc = myFunction()`)
- When a function is assigned to a variable with open and close parentheses (e.g. `let x = myFunction()`), the returned value of that function is stored in the variable.
- It is worth noting that in JavaScript, functions have an implicit return of `undefined` if a return statement is not specified within the function.
- This behavior can be utilized to store the returned values of functions for further use within the code, which can be beneficial for programmatic operations and data manipulation.
